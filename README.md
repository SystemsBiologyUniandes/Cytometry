# Cytometry

to [install fcsparser](https://github.com/eyurtsev/fcsparser) :  pip install fcsparser

FCSparser - converts a bunch of fcs files to csv files and plots some statistics
Work in progress - plots the thing

Troubleshooting:
- Check for installed packages
- Check folders exist
- Check OS syntaxis

This applies absolutely NO filter in the data, the data is parsed as measured by the cytometer.
